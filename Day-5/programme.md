1.Write a programme  which accepts a number and checks whether it is pallindrome or not
e.g
If user input 313, it returns true,because reading it from left to right, or from right to left gives the same number.

2. Write a programme which finds the LCM of two numbers
e.g
LCM(Least Common Multiple),a number which comes in multiples of both numbers
